</tr><tr><td>4472</td><td>MSN</td><td>ORD</td><td>3.0</td><td>6.0</td><td>I was scheduled to leave Sunday December 31st, but mechanical problems delayed us resulting in missing my connection in Chicago to San Diego which was the last flight available that day. when I went back to the service desk/check in to rebook I was waiting to get my bag back and an afro-american female united agent was assisting another gentleman re-book when she announced our delay was a mechanical problem with the plane. I did get re-booked on a 5:40 am flight the next morning by an agent on the phone but the gentleman next to me was having problems as he had the united basic economy ticket and she was not being very accommodating. at that point I stated I didn't feel that was right since it was united's "fault" for the delay and since he had the basic economy ticket couldn't do much. at that point she turned to me, and obviously not liking my comment stated she was not helping me and it was not my problem. and when the gentleman stated so it's your fault the plane isn't here she replied, no it's not my fault. she was obviously NOT dealing well with confrontation and did not give a good reflection on how the situation should have been handled. the other gentleman was very upset as he purchased his ticket not on united's website and said there was nothing really stating of the restrictions/limitations with purchasing the basic economy ticket. he finally did have to talk with a manager then to find any resolve. I experienced the same exact situation in november 2017 on the same flight from San Diego to Madison where the flight back (Madison to Chicago) had problems so people needed to be re-booked. I never found out the reasons why that time but in any situation like this one, if it would be united's "fault" for the delay-you know what you do what you can to accommodate a passenger. so whether they have whatever ticket with united, you should do whatever it takes to get that passenger to their final destination. I know the gentleman was very upset and said he would never fly united again. personally I will also look at other airlines when I have to fly back to Madison again in 5 months. I do not like how united has created this "cheaper" ticket "level" which limits the passenger a lot including not being able to choose a seat, not being able to bring a carry on, limited options on rebooking to name a few. and it's not cheaper-you just created another level to charge the customer more. this year with everything added together my round trip ticket to Madison WI from San Diego was basically $600! I had been pricing tickets probably 4-5 months prior waiting for prices to come down and they never did-so I am not sure why I kept hearing ticket prices were down this year-time you add on all the extra fees you have to pay now...I have never had to pay so much for a ticket before. (I'm digressing however). and personally I did pay extra for my ticket only later to find out 1.) the flight from Madison to Chicago somehow got to Madison and took off and completed the trip in half the scheduled time so if I would have actually taken that flight chances are I probably would have made my connection (why and how I even got rebooked then is confusing to me). instead I now got re-booked on a 5:40 am flight which means having to get up at 3 am (as well as my 80 year old parents) to get to the airport on time to check luggage etc. so my day I am supposed to</td><td>-0.991</td></tr>

I was traveling alone with an infant and had a car seat base to check, rather than politely informing what to do or simply helping me do it as the attendant did from LAX to ORD, she rudely ignored me when I tried handing the item to her. Then when I mentioned I needed to check the item, she snotily replied You need to check it at the kiosk. I said I tried but it wasn’t clear how to do it. Again, with an attitude she told me to go to the kiosk and ask the man that was standing there. It’s frustrating and makes a person anxious enough traveling alone with a 4month old but to be tested so rudely right at the beginning of a trip makes it that much harder and stressful. I’d also like to mention that because I purchased, and have in the past, a seat for my infant I knew their car seat needed to be placed in a seat by the window. However, other passengers do not realize this all the time. If I’m purchasing a ticket for an infant their seat when checking in should automatically be selected as a window seat rather than whatever two seats the computer may select because this creates unnecessary friction when I, as a passenger, have to inform another passenger that I have taken their seat because this is where the car seat is required to go. It would help if an attendant were there to inform passengers or if they were informed when purchasing a window seat this situation is possible to occur.</td><td>-0.9528</td></tr>

<tr><td>402</td><td>EWR</td><td>BOS</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>I will be calling to speak with someone about my family's experience. I was traveling with my husband 2.5 year old son, and infant. We purchased three seats. From the moment we arrived in Newark to check in for our flight to Boston, we had a bad experience. A very busy day (new years day) at the airport and there was only one representative to assist with kiosk check in. We had an infant and a car seat to check, which automatically requires assistance from a United Airlines representative. We waited a very long time. As my husband was working on getting tickets and the car seat tag from the kiosk, I waited in the baggage line.  The representative behind the counter immediately accused us of cutting the line. She did not say hello - just yelled at us. It was very poor customer service, accusatory, and wrong.  She was relentless and didn't believe that I had waited in line.   We arrived on the plane and discovered that someone had vomited in our seats prior to our arrival. This must have happened on the previous flight. The smell was sickening and there was throw up everywhere - pieces on the seat belt, front of the seats, top of the seat. I flagged down a flight attendant who barely acknowledged me and finally came over after about 10 minutes. Yes, it was busy, but this was a bit of an urgent situation and I was being extremely patient and polite. When she approached us, she immediately was accusatory. She did  not say hello or what can I help with, she immediately said - you are not supposed to be sitting here. We were shocked and confused as those were our seats. She was extremely rude. She did not have her information correct and acknowledged that after about a minute, but what a horrible way to start a conversation especially considering the disgusting situation we were dealing with in the seats. The flight attendant arranged for the cleaning crew to come on board as we stood for 20 minutes in the aisle with our two young kids waiting. The cleaning crew replaced the seat cover, seat belt and wiped down the area. Great. But, we discovered this wasn't sufficient as all of our bags that were on the floor smelled terribly of vomit.  We arrived home and threw away our bags and clothing since it had been soaking up someone else's vile.   I still remain shocked by the two accusatory situations we were in -  for absolutely no reason. A very calm and polite family with well behaved children who was doing everything correctly. I am upset that there was no apology for the seat situation and that this was not recognized prior to us boarding. This is a health issue and I am concerned that my family has now contracted norovirus.   I look forward to speaking with someone about this matter.

People, including the flight attendants, kept bumping into me.  At one point, one of the flight attendants stood on my foot that was straight down against the seat, despite there being five feet in front of me.  There was a baby crying in the row behind me, and the woman in my row kept throwing a fit about it (I just kept my headphones turned up, so the crying didn't bother me, but I felt really bad for that family). I suppose that my experience on the flight was partially my fault when I agreed to switch to an isle seat, but I don't understand how people can bump into someone sitting there and not even apologize - especially the flight attendants.

Not only were they causing a delay, but they were also causing uneasiness among the passengers due to the disturbance that ensued. The flight attendants were struggling to get them to cooperate. Then, the family also refused to sit down because they wanted a special seat for their baby, which the flight attendant told them was unavailable. The Passengers all started getting worried about this man and his family, and for 20 minutes we listened to the arguments. I do not know why airport security was not brought on to this flight. At this day in age if it is taking 20 minutes to get a passenger to sit in his assigned seat and cooperate it should be seen as a safety risk.

United needs to do whatever it can to move to Terminal 3.  We should have had Terminal 2 listed on the ticket or sent to us in an e-mail.  The check-in screwed up, and they had to recheck our tickets manually after we had boarded the aircraft and were seated.  Seating people from both ends of the plane was not a time saver, as folks from the back end had to go forward against traffic to find places for their carry-ons, which led to a logjam and a lot of frustration.  They didn't load the food properly for the flight, and water wasn't handed out until about 90 minutes after we boarded the plane and sat in heat for about 45 minutes of that time during the baggage and ticket screw-up.

He received that suitcase and was excited to use it on this trip to Chicago.  When we got back to DC and received the bags he noticed that his brand new suitcase had been damaged in numerous places.  These were not mere scratches or smudges, but damage to the seams that exposed the wire underneath in three different places and damage to one of the zippers that will result in it needing to be replaced. We immediately took the bag to the United desk to file a claim.  We were informed that because the damage did not prevent the bag from holding luggage, United would do nothing to repair the bag.  My son is very disappointed.  And as a senior leader at a multi-billion company, I'm embarrassed that any company (let alone one of the largest airlines in the world) would risk losing a customer over a torn $100 bag.     I should note that I am a fairly regular United flier, but my experience the with United in 2017 has been miserable.  This trip was no different.  Prior to leaving for Chicago, I discovered that United had bumped all five members of my party and we had no seats, despite having made reservations months in advance.  I called and luckily we were able to secure our original seats on the flight out.  For the return flight (this flight) we were not able to do that and we forced to selected seats near the rear of the plane.  When we boarded the plane, I noticed that our original seats were listed on the display in blue, meaning that they were empty.  Running an airline is a logistical nightmare.  I get there will be bumps.  But my past year with United has been miserable.  This flight was the icing on a really bad year.  I hope it will get better.</td><td>-0.8978</td></tr>

We ended up sitting in two sets of two. Not convenient.  2. My kids became unaccompanied minors in the United system which caused a number of issues, including an extended check-in process that could not be done on-line 3. The rest of my family lost their group 1 status - not a big issue, just annoying 4. Part of my family lost their pre-check status  I specifically declined the upgrade option to avoid this. We were upgraded in Chicago because space was needed in economy. Still, even with an upgrade, the above should not happen.

They started boarding group 1 and 2 and said that group three should stay seated. As I was extremely tired, I apparently was overcome by sleep and woke up after the boarding was completed. I rushed to the desk, and the agents yelled at me because it was 11 minutes before the flight. They said they paged me overhead, which I of course did not hear. Instead of coming to wake me up, or expressing any sympathy with how tired I was, they rebuked me, and said they had to check in my carry-on, which was an extremely small piece that usually fits under the seat in front of me. My seat was 8 F, but for some reason, they had changed it to 19 F. Every time I said something about the seat or the carry-on, they would say, then do not get on this flight and we will put you on the next flight. I did get on the flight but the 19 F seat is so squashed that it was even difficult to get to it. When I asked the flight attendant to give me my original seat, she called the agent. Another very rude agent came and kept saying you either sit here or we deplane you and put you on the next flight. Finally, I asked her to ask the person in seat 8 F how he or she got the seat. She would not do that, but a hostess did, and that person gave me my original seat back. The agent kept telling me to complain on line. I told her what good will it do me to complain after I suffer for 4 hours. She just kept saying I will put you on the next plane. I had been at a conference in Ventura county and had another conference in Chicago at 7 a.m. therefore there was no way for me to miss this flight and be placed on another flight, plus there was no reason for them to keep threatening me with this since I had an expensive ticket and had done nothing that necessitated such disrespectful and threatening treatment. I always fly Delta and try to avoid flying United or American because of such treatment that these airlines have become known for.

The woman at bag drop off was downright snotty about trying to fix it for me, telling me that I could check online.  But why would I check on line when a SECOND agent at Mileage Plus told me it was fine?  Am I just supposed to never believe an agent on the phone when they tell me they have accomplished what I called about?  At the gate, the agent was much nicer, and she tried to put the number on for me, and apparently another agent tried to help her over the phone.  But I still need to call, now a THIRD time, not including the help I tried to get at the airport for the problem.  Another issue is that this was a basic economy ticket, which is a terrible idea and you should discontinue it.  My employer only allows the "basic" ticket, so if I fly for work and want to fly United, I will have to do this kind of ticket.  But it's ridiculous to not get a carry on (which might or might not be waived if you have a Mileage Plus credit card, but it isn't clear which ones are "qualifying," and I couldn't get the Mileage number onto the card, as detailed above, so I didn't know whether that would be waived or not).  In addition, having no seat makes you feel as if you are flying standby, which is not viable when traveling for business.  It certainly can NOT save United time or money to have to have the agent find you a seat at the gate - that is completely counter to the automation you have turned to to save money.    Anyway, the flight was okay, even though I had a middle seat.  But the service in terms of the Mileage Plus number, including the agent at check in has been appalling -- I'm told one thing, but it's just not true.  And again, the Basic Economy is terrible, and if you leave this as an option, I will have no option but to stop flying United for business -- and I probably fly at least once a month for work.</td><td>-0.8781</td></tr>

I understood but I was also traveling with my pet. I asked the lady at the check-in desk if my pet would still fit on the new flight/plane. She said yes without really looking or checking. I pay $125 for the in-cabin pet. The standby flight arrived at 11:00, I board as the flight attendant tells me my pets carrier isn't going to fit and to get of the plane so they can figure out what to do.  I told her that the lady at the check-in desk said his carrier could fit under the seat and I already paid my $125. She tells me I can't fly with him and I can't Board the 11:00am flight. The manager (who was very professional) comes and ask who told me my pets carrier could fit? I told him it was the lady at check-in. They informed me she was supposed to measure the carrier to be sure it would fit on the new flight but she didn't which is how I got into this inconvenience. He and his employees try to find me a soft-sided carrier but they didn't have any. The gate attendant tells me that she can put me on the next flight out to Buffalo but it doesn't leave Atlanta until close to 4pm and there's a 4 hour layover in Newark, NJ and I wouldn't get to Buffalo until after 11pm, I had no other option but to take that flight and then had to leave the airport, pay for parking, find the nearest Petsmart and buy a soft sided carrier, come back to the airport go through security again. Needless to say I was very disappointed and frustrated with the entire situation which happened because someone didn't do their job right. She didn't even check the paperwork that my pet had the rabies shots and health certificate to fly which I paid $99 for. I feel like a lot of time and money was wasted had she done her job correctly all of this could have been avoided. She inconvenienced me, United Airlines, and her fellow co-workers. Probabaly the worst flying experience I've had. Basically spent my entire day in airports and airplanes with my pet. Very uncomfortable. However, I do appreciate how serious everyone took the incident. I was refunded my $125 and United did give me a $250 gift certificate for the inconvenience.

And they pointed to my stuff and made crass remarks. Without bothering to ask whose things they were, Lauren explained "well obviously that has to be changed", climbed up on the seat arm rests (didn't say excuse me and she was wearing a skirt) and actually grabbed my stuff and threw it to the the side in the bin. Never mind my bag had my corporate laptop and sensitive things that could have been damaged by the metal shelf. I said to her "ma'am, excuse me but their bags won't fit. There's a metal shelf there blocking most of tbe bin which is why I put my stuff there". She turns around, sneers at me and says "yah. I fly this plane a lot more than you do" and continues to shove my personal effects. Only to turn around , look at their luggage, and realize IT DOeSNT fit". So she walks on the arm rests to the next row of bins and starts shoving other people's stuff. Only to find that their bags aren't going to fit there either. So she ended up having to hate check and wasted a lot of time. Not only that but she left my stuff strewn in the bin and didn't even have the grace to put it back.  To make it worse, any time I tried to ask for something she treated me with extreme attitude. Until she came to make me pay for my cheese box and saw my Global Services card. Then her attitude changed somewhat. But honestly she shouldn't be treating anyone that way, let alone a global services member who flies enough to know how many bags fit In the bins....  she spent more time standing in tbe back talking about what clubs she was going to when she got home.

This conversation make me feel VERY anxious, since I am afraid of flying.  The crew member "Rey" was telling a co worker about how a Delta flight waited for so long and took off without "de-icing" the plane, and apparently, when that happens the plane does not get enough lift, so they crashed.  He then added in a sarcastic tone, "there were many survivors, like none".  I obviously felt worried and horrible because we had been waiting for a while and I had no idea if the airplane was properly defrosted or whatever.  The person he was talking to even replied something about him being so negative.  I think this obviously was an innapropiate conversation to be having in front of the passengers or when they can hear you loud and clear.

Then, when I went to check us in for our return, Sean did not have a ticket – even though I was told he would when we left Newark.  I called customer support and was told I did not have a ticket, since he did not fly out and that was considered a change.  The reps told me the agent at the desk was not correct and I had to buy a one way ticket for $173. Reason I was not happy with United and will definitely consider not flying with United again unless absolutely necessary >I was told by a United employee that all I had to do is not check him in and he will have a ticket back.  I realize I did not read all the fine print, but I would expect a United employee to give me the correct answer.  That expectation was incorrect.  And as I told the customer service rep, it should not be a customer’s job to know United employees responsibilities.  If that agent did not have the right answer, she should have told me to ask another United person or call a rep – NOT give me an incorrect answer.  If I had known he did not have a ticket, I would have had him go home with the people he went out with. >If my ticket gets cancelled, I would expect at least an email that my ticket is cancelled.  Because Sean was a no show, my ticket was cancelled.  I heard nothing from United with that information.  It should be part of the system to notify a customer when the ticket is cancelled. >In my naivety, I did not consider this a change.  I considered it – me paying for something I did not use (the flight to Detroit). >Lastly, the customer service reps were very confrontation and not helpful.  One rep – Millie – even questioned my parenting skills and how I could let my 14 year go to Detroit with another family.  She also asked how a 14 could drive – which was ridiculous.  These comments caused the conversation to escalate to a point where I said things I actually apologized for.  I will not have a customer service rep question my parenting or any behavior.  That is ridiculous and very poor customer service.  Also, I asked to speak to her supervisor and Millie told me she did not have one.    Until I refused to talk further and asked many more times, did she transfer me to another representative.

<tr><td>1246</td><td>FLL</td><td>EWR</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>Date: 1/18/17 Flight #: UA1246  (Fort Lauderdale > Newark) Mileage Plus #: FJ360459  It was a packed flight with only a few open seats.  I’m sitting in seat 30D next two a mother/father and 22-month old child.  The father was sitting next to me with the baby on his lap and he says – I have to apologize up-front as my child has an ear ache and he screamed most of the last flight. As the plane begins to move away from the gate the baby starts to wail and upon take-off his screams of agony can be heard through the entire plane.  The screaming last for quite some time and I would often let the father out to walk up/down the aisle to try and conform the child.   I don’t fault the child or parents.  I’m a father of 3 and I know how difficult it can be to travel with children.  But what happened next was inexcusable.  About 45 minutes into the flight I got up to let the father out and I noticed that there was an open seat toward the front of the plane.  The mother/father wanted to lay their child down and I offered to move seats to accommodate.  I brought it up to the flight attendant – Who responded:  No, I’m sorry.  That seat is economy plus and you paid for an economy seat.  And I was told I could NOT move…unless I wanted to pay for an upgrade.  Wait…what?!?!  I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.  Nor could the passengers around me.  For some reason, the flight attendant thought that the airline would lose money – or perhaps she thought she would lose her job – if I was allowed to move to this seat.  The baby continued to scream…and scream.. and only subsided for a very short while on 3+ hour flight.  In short, the baby screamed the entire flight.    What exactly do you think economy plus is anyway?  It’s the same seat with slightly more leg room.  I wasn’t asking to move to 1st class…just a different seat to help accommodate the parents, baby and I….not to mention all of the other passengers that were forced to endure the situation.  I ended moving asking some folks to shift economy seats and move a few rows ahead.  This further irrigated those that were asked to move.  United boasts about exceptional customer experience – and being all about the passenger and flight experience.  United – You failed at the expense of several passengers.  And why – because you lost sight of passenger(s) satisfaction over the incorrectly perceived notation about cost and/or airline process.  To rub a little salt in the wound – I stopped by the united customer service desk on my way out and relayed my disappointment in a very kind and courteous manner.  They couldn’t have cared less and told me to call united when I got home.  I have no doubt that I will receive some form of automated message in response to this complaint.  And maybe a coupon for a future flight.  Unfortunately – I have already booked several additional united flights for me and my family.  Once completed, you can rest assured knowing that I will not fly United as long as I have an option.  You can go ahead and close my account, my mileage plus account and flush your points down the drain.  I plan on sharing my story to all who will listen.  You failed United.</td><td>-0.9172</td></tr>

Three minutes later, F FA was asking for empty cup.  Really?  FA saw I had my two coats on my lap twice.  I offered him my coats to hang up.  Both times, he refused saying, “I’ll be back for your coats.”    Boarding was chaotic.  F FA was watching the chaos and not doing anything about it.  She was holding people from boarding while F class pax were waiting for their boarding beverage.  No effort to hang up coats.  F FA did nothing to make sure seat backs were in the full upright position before take-off.  Pax in front of me was reclined throughout take-off.  Direct TV ran the promo trailer video four times through take-off and leveling off.  Take off was around 7:30pm, Direct TV programming not available until 8:10pm.  F FA enjoyed his bottle of UA water in the view of F pax while none of the pax had their drinks.  “Me first, you second.”  Catering boarded insufficient meals.  F FA told me I had a choice of Chicken Tandoori or a Snack Box.  This is a flight that is nearly three hours.  I didn’t get dinner at ORD because you advertised it as a dinner flight in F.  I guess because I am a 1K the FA “gifted” me the chicken tandoori.  My seat (4E, 737-800) would not stay in the upright position.  I had a lot of work to do and needed to type.  I cannot type in the recline position.  I re-adjusted my seat countless times during the flight.  The toilet seat would not remain in the up position for a male to urinate.  Ugh.

It took several agents to resolve and no one was able to explain who authorized the change in my record and said it should never have occurred.

We thought we purchased an A.M. flight, to realize we were on a P.M. flight.  This was so upsetting to us as we had tickets to a matinee show that we missed, not to mention cutting our trip a day short.  Yes, it was our fault, but, a mistake that could have simply been rectified due to the fact that the morning flight, at the time we realized this, was wide open.  Unfortunately, Chicago had bad weather and the cancellation of flights the day before created a situation that caused the morning flight to become full.  I was very glad I didn't pay to upgrade our tickets, and than find out we would have never gotten on this flight anyway.  This policy is dispicable and feels like you are gauging your passengers, and we will  use your airlines only if everything else fails in getting flights from other airlines.  To think that a seat to San Antonio is not a full fair ticket at the price we paid, was more than disappointing.  The fact that you wouldn't do everything possible to change a ticket whenever possible is very disappointing.

Bear in mind, I have flown with this bag on all United aircraft for the past 6 years (as a Global Services member three years in a row and 1K each year before that). I fly A LOT. This bag was not expanded and would certainly fit in the overheads of this A320 as it has for years and years. On top of this insult, I saw many people board the plane after me with bags that would not fit in the overheads. I was irate. Secondly, during the food and beverage service (I was in economy) the flight attendant was extremely rude to me and told me I needed to order a certain way - instead of telling her I was GS at the end of my order and showing her my boarding pass, she condescendingly told me I needed to tell her first that I was GS. This makes no sense - she would look me up at either point either way and should not matter one way or another. She then insisted I was in the wrong seat because she had trouble locating me in her device. Turns out I was in the right seat after all. Surprise.

As you can see from the history of my messages, there has been no acknowledgement to my comments re: dealing with booking on United’s website. Furthermore, my praises were only for Patrick, not to his supervisor nor senior management. If I had received consistent and sufficient satisfactory service from your representatives during my current patronage with United, then I’d have complimented them as well. Not responding in a timely manner (or at all) to my disappointment from both 1K voice and Customer Care (Mr. Johnson) supports my opinion on how this behavior exhibits the lack of respect you have for both your customers and yourselves. What  is the point of having 1K status? I would really appreciate an answer or should I not bother to expect United to accept responsibility.   My recent flight from TAO to YUL (I48EEJ) via ORD and BOS was a disaster. At check-in, my reservation on the connecting flight to ORD/BOS/YUL was CANCELLED and even though I was on-time for boarding at check-in at PEK, I was informed of the cancellation, and then subsequently waited at the gate for 15 minutes as the agents tried to sort it out while passengers boarded. Needless to say, I lost the original confirmed seat and was now seated at the bulkhead. Because of physical discomfort from prolonged watching the IFE screen at a downward angle (limited mobility in my neck), I had no video entertainment for the next 12+ hours. Furthermore, the washrooms were significantly further because I had lost my originally booked seat which created more discomfort since I have stiffness in my hip joints (another reason for booking aisle seating). Then, on the ORD-BOS leg, I was again assigned a further seat and not an aisle but the dreaded window seat, an additional “pain” to struggle to the restroom. So I definitely did not enjoy my flights. Update: As I am writing this feedback, it had dawned on me that maybe the return leg of my trip was cancelled as well. A quick check on my United account confirmed that and now I am on the phone to the 1K desk with Annabel to correct this. Not looking good, United!!!! Well, Annabel has come through and re-booked me, kudos to her! But this shouldn’t have happened in the first place. Why didn’t the Beijing gate agents who told me that my flight was cancelled take the steps then to recover the complete reservation and avoid my referring to this current episode? One step forward, but two steps back. I really don’t need any added stress to my life.    Dear Mr. Johnson (or whoever is actually reading this),    I can only imagine how swamped you are in replying to United Pax since you've failed to acknowledge my frustrations in trying to book a flight on United's website.

The representative assured me that I would be on a window seat, as I made note to her that it would be extremely distracting for the animal to work with people walking by all the time. When I arrived at the HNL airport, I checked in, and was told there was no note on my reservation that I would have an animal with me. I explained that I had done so more than a month ago. The attendant made me wait over an hour to make a phone call and get things confirmed. I had also given my license to the TSA representative, and never got it back, causing further complication. Though I had to carry on without it because I had been so significantly delayed by the animal reservation complication. When I boarded, my seat was on an isle, despite previous reassurance that I had a window. The animal had complications and was less able to do her job as a result, though no major problem happened other than extreme stress and risk.   On my return flight, I moved smoothly through an extremely long security line, and when I approached the gate, notified the service person at the gate desk that I was traveling with a service animal, and needed to make sure I had a bulkhead window seat. She took over an hour, after boarding had already begun, to notify my that a seat change was made, without asking any questions or asking if the change was acceptable. My seat was changed to a window seat in row 38, CLEARLY not a bulk head. After excessive difficultly boarding with the animal, and being unable to fit into the seat with the animal anywhere else besides my lap (meaning I had to spend 10+ hours with a large animal on my lap!!), I attempted to get the attention of an attendant prior to take off, but was ignored and disreagarded. I looked for a way to alert the crew using the standard “call attendant” button usually found, but didn’t find any way to alert for help. After take off, I didn’t see another attendant until drunk/food service began. An older, black with short greying hair, female attendant, wearing a blue jacket approached and asked if I wanted a drink. I requested water, and attempted to hand her a hydro flask, but was denied, as she claimed I could only have one cup. I explained that I would need more for my animal and myself, she said she could give me only one cup more for the animal, and that I could have more when she returned on her next trip. As I was unable to call an attendant, I had to get out of my seat to request more water, traipsing over the polite customer next to me with the animal, causing her and I both discomfort and frustration. I had to do this multiple times, as the drink service only came through three times, with the same rude attendant, as of my knowledge. Anytime I had to use the rest room, I had to ask the guest next to me to stand, let us out, and it was extraordinarily unpleasant. My discomfort had gotten so bad with the animal on my lap that I had to stand repeatedly to alleviate the pain.

Unfortunately, 7C was occupied by a mother with two children, one of which had a special needs seat.  We told the flight attendant that they had two passengers with the same seat and it needed to be fixed.  She told us that she needed to speak with the gate agent.

We suggested that they put the woman in our seat right in front of us in an unused first class seat (which stayed empty for the entire flight).  She refused and attempted to have me sit apart from my husband.  We again suggested the empty first class seat.  She told me that that was, "outside of her ability." At this time everyone else was on the plane.  The gate agent then proceeded to ask every row if the passengers were flying alone so she could move both my husband and myself.  This was frustrating and time consuming.  We were finally relocated to seats further back on the plane.  No one asked me if I had paid extra for the seats in that section. Luckily I had not, but I found it inappropriate and rude for the gate agent to move us back on the plane without considering how much you charge to sit further up in the plane.  The hour and 20 minute flight was fine, but I am appalled by how your staff acted.  There was no reason the older woman, who needed wheelchair assistance when we landed, couldn't have sat two feet in front of the seat she was in.  Your first class on that flight had at least 3 empty seats.  Your gate agent stated that she herself had changed the seats for the mother (who definitely should have been in the bulkhead seats).  I have worked in customer service for many years.  I know that when you mess up you make things right.  In the future I will be looking for my flights elsewhere.  I don't want to fly with people who make mistakes and are unwilling to fix them without inconveniencing and passing the buck onto others.

If this is the case, also, inappropriate! I paid A LOT of money for my ticket. Just because I'm not gold or whatever doesn't allow UA not to let people board. Why should someone who is in row 35C but has status board before me??  JetBlue does NOT allow passengers to put their coats and small bags on top, they must be under their seat. Your staff should do a better job controlling was it being placed on board. I noticed a woman asking another woman if she could move her children's SMALL backpacks and the woman wouldn't. This is ridiculous!  Not only was your gate agent inappropriate with me, UA in a way segregates people due to their class. So, I ended up waiting for my luggage, that came on board with me to Managua and back. I would like a refund on the economy plus seat I purchased, plus an explanation of UA's boarding process. Please understand that these negative experiences make me NOT want to book United. I've tried to let this go, especially being a yogi, but besides the gate agent, checking in my luggage - United did not have a person assigned to the jetway in EWR, which left us on the plane for an additional hour and frozen conveyor belts not allowing us getting our luggage for two hours, getting home at 2:30am was not a great experience.
